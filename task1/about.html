        A collegiate institute is an institution that provides either secondary or post-secondary education, dependent on where the term is used. In Canada, the term is used to describe an institutions that provide secondary education, while the word is used to describe a 
        post-secondary institutions in the United States.
        The term has fallen out of use throughout most of North America, except in the Canadian province of Ontario,
         which continues to use the term in the names of their secondary schools. Variations of the term also see 
         use in other parts of Canada, with select areas of western Canada using the term collegiate in the names of
          their secondary schools.
